# Autoinstall
> Short blurb about what your product does.

## Execution

Linux:

```sh
sudo ./run.py
```

## Usage example

This script is designed based on a common problem when migrating between Debian distributions.
It all starts with a question: What had installed in my previous distribution?

To solve this problem that arose when migrating between LMDE, Debian, Crunchbangs (now Bunsenlabs) and other Debian-based distributions, I happened to create a script that loops through a list of applications and libraries and will automatically installing (something like a requirements.txt, but with apps)

That's how we got here.

In the file config.py we have 2 variables, one APPLICATIONS call and the other ADDITIONAL_COMMANDS:

APPLICATIONS has the following format:

```
APPLICATIONS = [ 'application_name', 'application_name']
```

ADDITIONAL_COMMANDS has the following format:

```
ADDITIONAL_COMMANDS = { 'application_name': [ 'TERMINAL_COMMAND']}
```


APPLICATIONS is required to run the script.

ADDITIONAL_COMMANDS should only be completed if needed. For example, when installing 'virtualbox' we should add our user to vboxusers group then becomes:

ADDITIONAL_COMMANDS = { 'virtualbox': [ 'adduser $ USERNAME vboxusers']}
